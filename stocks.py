import math

# Create a function that will represent the price
# an Employee will be able to purchase stock
def stockPrice(chosenPrice):
	chosenPrice = 100.0
	start = 100.0
	end = 150.0
	if chosenPrice >= start:
		print("Employee Stock Price: ", end)
	# else chosenPrice <= start:
		# print("Employee Stock Price: ", start)

# I don't want the values to be given
# I want the user to enter the values
# Then, based on the entered values by the user,
# 'chosenPrice' will be assigned a value
# 'chosenPrice' will equal the lowest value between
# 'start' and 'end'
